        <h2>Research Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Examination Drought Impacts on Vegetation across U S. Using Machine Learning Models | Independent Project Sept 2024 - Present University of Michigan, Ann Arbor
                Processed NDVI and SPEI data for temporal analysis of vegetation
                Incorporated lagged SPEI variables to study delayed vegetation responses to drought
                Trained machine learning models to predict NDVI with drought-induced lag effects and interpreted key drivers using feature importance and Shapley values.</li>
            
            <li>Quantifying Carbon Storage in Illinois Restored Ecosystems with Remote Sensing Techniques, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, USA Jan 2024 - Present University of Michigan, Ann Arbor
                 Utilized LiDAR data to calculate Canopy Height Model(CHM) in R
                 Integrated Machine Learning to train models for biomass estimation
                 Created a formula to fit biomass from field measurements and CHM from LiDAR using nonlinear regression to improve the precision of carbon storage predictions</li>
            <li>Developed geospatial models to predict environmental trends using Random Forest and RNN.</li>
